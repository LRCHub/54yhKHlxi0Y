I'm down on my knees here
What can I do
Started a fire but it's burning right through
Was gifted the picture but I twisted the view
There'll always be something on my mind
Somewhere behind the perfect line

Yes I'm giving everything I can
I'm going back to Samarkand
Give me a reason give me a rhyme
One flash of light and I'll make it all mine
Make it all mine all mine all mine

I'll sleep in between you with butterfly wings
You'll never believe that I'm not what I seem
I lie for the moment that lives in my dreams
There'll always be someone to blow your mind

Yes I'm taking everything I can.
I'm going out to Samarkand
Give me a reason give me a rhyme
See me in season on the cover of time
Changing my face now to suit your design
One flash of light and I'll make it all mine
Make it all mine all mine all mine.
