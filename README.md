# ONE OK ROCK – All Mine

```
All my problems they will run away
from you and I see
All the angels sit and stare at you
You are everything but not today
I'm so down and out
'cause something is wrong without you
When you're not around
Just shadows and rain fall
Wait till tomorrow
I'll wait
Just wanna be with you
Only you
Always you
You're so beautiful to me
It's true
Amazed by you
I think I'm falling
All my worries they just sleep in late,
lying next to you
But I fall to pieces and crumble away
Today nothing works
I'm so down and out
'cause something is wrong without you
When you're not around
Just shadows and rain fall
Wait till tomorrow
Can't wait
Just wanna be with you
Only you
Always you
You're so beautiful to me
It's true
Amazed by you
I think I'm falling
Falling with you
Only you
Always you
You're so beautiful to me
It's true
Amazed by you
I know I'm falling
